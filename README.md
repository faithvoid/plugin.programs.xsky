- Add some way to differentiate between a post and a reply
- Add reply chains(?)
- Add "Following / Followers" options to view posts from specific users in those categories
- Add profile information (ie; name + avatar - bio) as first 2 options when viewing a profile
- Store login data somewhere that isn't just a plaintext file?
- Find a way to leverage Bluesky's chat functionality for an IM service(?)
